number,reason
-67,"Because 67 is a cool number, and I assume other people will give +67, and then it makes sense to multiply a negative sum by a negative number to make it positive"
14,I dunno
-100,"I think most players will choose a positive number, so in the end the sum will be negative, which will make my result positive"
50,It was the first one that came to mind because I was overwhelmed by the description of the mathematical calculations
24,Because that’s how I feel (so-called master intuition)
-100,"Because when 4 other people give the largest possible numbers, the sum will be negative, and multiplying it by -100 will give the maximum result"
7,Siu
1,I have a gut feeling
216,Yesterday I was happy when I saw the cube root of this number
27,I like this number
25,I’m playing alone :(
19,Because it’s unique
6,Just because
4,Because I like it
39,My age is a good result
8,8.33 would be better... :)
13,My favorite
7,Lucky for me
4,I guessed
9,To maximize the result
100,I chose this number randomly
1134,Hello
11,Because it’s my lucky number
5,"It’s easy to multiply, subtract, etc."
15,Randomly
25,Psychology suggests that aiming for half can give you more than going all in XDDD
1,The easiest to calculate
12,No reason
"-1,00E+23",It is most likely that the sum of the other people’s numbers will be greater than 50
13,It’s my favorite
-100,Because two negatives make a positive
49,Because two negatives make a positive
10,"I doubt this is the optimal solution; it’s not supported by calculations, more by faulty intuition"
8,At random
-1000000000000,"If no range is given, the sum of the five numbers will probably be negative. To get the maximum result, I need the smallest possible number"
22,Birthday
5,Because I like 5
11111,"As many ones as there are people in the game, i.e. 11111"
25,"25 always wins or draws; if the sum of the remaining numbers is 24 or less, I win; if the sum equals 25, everyone draws"
13,Because it brings me luck....
1,"The rules of the game are unclear. It was not explained what numbers should be given (their range, whether they are given aloud or anonymously, and whether they can repeat). The result may be negative, which changes a lot in the game"
2,Just because
8,Just felt like it
21,My favorite
7,Because it’s a cool number
5,For fun
67,Because it’s funny
200,No one will win if it’s 0
67,67
3,It’s my lucky number
-100,My number will be the largest among the negative results
50,Let the least greedy person win
7777777,My favorite digits
5,"The numerical range was not specified, but I assume it is from 0 to 10. I would choose 5 assuming each player maximizes their individual result"
1750,"Condition 1: I assume we operate within the set of positive numbers. For the result to be the highest, the sum of the five numbers must be the smallest, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Their sum is 15, so 50 − 15 = 35. To maximize the product, this should be multiplied by the highest number in the set, 50. Result: 35 × 50 = 1750"
6,"I chose the number 42 (a book says it is the answer to everything), then I added 4 and 2"
3,Because 3 is my lucky number and it can’t hurt that much
67,"If I give too small a number, it’s obvious; if a negative one, I have no chance unless someone else also gives a negative. Intuitively, since there are infinitely many numbers, there is no winning strategy, so 67 is the best choice"
2,"The smaller the number, the larger the multiplication result"
-1000,"It will go below zero and then, when multiplied, become a large positive number — unless others do the same, but gambling ftw"
67,67
67,67
"-1,00E+63","There is a high chance that S will be negative, and multiplying it by a negative number will give a huuuge result"
28,Lately it seems to be a lucky number for me
-100,"There is a high chance that S will be negative, and multiplying it by a negative number will give a large result"
1,"It simplifies calculations, and I’m not able to predict other players’ choices anyway"
4,"This is a random game, I have no influence over others, and 4 was the first number that came to mind"
34,"I chose the number 34 because my brain used simplified decision-making mechanisms (heuristics). I avoided extreme and round numbers, and 34 lies in the middle range, appearing neutral and random. The decision was automatic rather than conscious"
9,My son’s birthday
7,It’s my lucky number. Would you like to contact me? I’d be happy to learn more +** *** *** ***
33,It is my master number in numerology
25,Just because
25,Because it’s in the middle and makes the most sense
-1,67
10,I have no idea. I’d guess. I’m just a humanities person ;)
12,"My school roll number, and today it was lucky. Seriously though, I’m bad at math and this seems like the best option"
1,It will allow me to achieve the highest possible result
-100000000,"If we subtract all numbers from 50, we get a very large negative number, and multiplying it by my negative number gives a very large positive result"
1,So that the highest result comes out
4,Idk
45,Because 1 was my number and others’ as well
"1,00E+114","Big number, big result"
"-1,00E+20","With minus infinity, the game cannot be won. Too much depends on randomness (other people)"
10,My friend chose -10 https://tenor.com/pl/view/steamhappy-steam-happy-steam-happy-emoji-gif-8108676584237132839
-10,I’m betting that others will choose numbers such that S will be negative. I’m not choosing a smaller number because then S has a smaller chance of being negative — at least that’s how it seems to me
37,"The number I choose always ends with 7, and the 3 is random"
13,My lucky number
10,10
9,The other people chose zero (because I can choose the number for them). Multiplying the resulting number 41 × 9 gives the highest result (369)
10,"I expect the other participants to choose a number from the lower end of the first ten, and my final result will be the highest"
1,"In this way I obtain my first multiplier (×1), the highest possible, and the second is shared among all five players"
24,I like 24
7,It’s easier to multiply mentally when it’s a single-digit number
4,It was my school roll number
51,I wanted to choose a number greater than 50 but not too large
15,I chose 15 because that’s how old I am :)
10,The first one that came to mind
10,Randomly
5,5 to get the highest possible multiplication result
8.5,The most optimal number
-100000,"No range was given; I could choose a larger number, but I didn’t feel like typing it. I know both multiplied numbers are negative, so the result will be positive"
5,That’s what I think
25,I won’t do worse than them
2026,The current year
